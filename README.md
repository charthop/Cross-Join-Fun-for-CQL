# Cross Join Fun
###### _When the client needs every combination of everything all at once_

In this repository we use Pandas and Python to imitate an SQL cross-join. This gives us a DataFrame with all the combinations of all the rows of data (staying in order left to right). Using that data frame, we then concat a CQL expression for each combination and convert the data frame into a JSON file for the API push into ChartHop.
